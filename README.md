# Instructions for Maya

Docs-as-code is a methodology that lets you write docs in the same way that engineers write code for applications In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the docs-as-code workspace. 

You will download existing code from David, update this code and send it back to Dave. Then you will see how the code edit updates a real-life website.

## Prerequisites:

1. GitHub Desktop
2. GitHub Login
3. Visual Studio Code
4. Existing Code - davidmyriel/cd-dave-mkdocs

## Setup

1. Open GitHub Desktop and download a copy of the repository: https://github.com/davidmyriel/cx-dave-mkdocs.git 
2. Access the repository via Visual Studio Code. Familiarize yourself with the arrangement of files and folders.
3. From GitHub Desktop, select a working branch, so as to not affect the main branch.
4. Make a change in a file, Save it and check the `git status`.
