## Azure Resource Manager Deployments

Coralogix provides several trigger strategies with any of the following **automatic** integrations using Azure resource manager (ARM) custom template deployments:

- [Event Hub](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/azure-eventhub-trigger-function/)

- [Blob Storage](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/blobstorage-microsoft-azure-functions/)

- [Queue Storage](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/queue-storage-microsoft-azure-functions/)

- [Diagnostic Data](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/diagnostic-data-microsoft-azure-resource-manager-arm/)

## Optional Configurations

In addition, we offer [optional configurations](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/optional-configurations-microsoft-azure/) for particular use-cases utilizing our Azure deployments. If you require resource monitoring in Azure storage accounts or Event Hubs that cannot be made public, [deploy our function apps with virtual network (VNet) support](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/optional-configurations-microsoft-azure/#storage-accounts--event-hubs-with-restricted-public-access).

## Terraform Modules

Using our Terraform modules, you can easily install and manage Coralogix integrations with Azure services as modules in your infrastructure code:

- [Event Hub](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/terraform-modules-for-azure-eventhub/)

- [Blob Storage via Event Grid](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/terraform-modules-for-azure-blob-storage-via-event-grid/)
