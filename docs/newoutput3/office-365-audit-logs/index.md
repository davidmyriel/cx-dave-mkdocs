Knowing who does what and accesses which files, mailboxes,Â  and so on in your Office 365 is crucial to the security of your environment. With Filebeat and Coralogix you will be able to audit these actions.

The steps below will help you configure your office 365 to send audit logs to Coralogix.

## Enable Auditing in Office 365

Log in to your Office 365 and find the Admin tab:

## Create an app

Go to Azure Portal: [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/)

Log in with the same credentials as your Office 365.

Look for the Azure Active Directory in the left menu and click:

Under owned applications tab, select the app you have created. You will see the info needed for the FileBeat Office 365 module to allow authentication to your Office 365 and grabbing the audit logs.

You also need certificates or a secret key that you should generate or upload under Client credentials on the same page.
