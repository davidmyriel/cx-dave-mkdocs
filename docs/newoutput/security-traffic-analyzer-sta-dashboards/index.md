When you install the Coralogix Security Traffic Analyzer (STA) for the first time (and optionally in subsequent installations too) the following dashboards will be automatically added to your account:

## **Baby Domains**

Displays young domains that were created in the last three months that were accessed by the monitored servers. Normally, this dashboard should be empty, for the purpose of this example we have changed the condition to show connection to domains that were created in the past 30 years just so that you'll get a feeling of what it looks like:

## **Zeek**

### **Connections**

Displays information about connections observed by the STA. Includes information such as protocols (e.g. TCP, UDP, ICMP), ports, connection states (e.g. SYN, ACK, PSH, FIN), geographic locations and more.

### DNS

Displays information about DNS queries and answers detected in the monitored traffic. Includes information such as queries, DNS servers, response codes, geographic locations, protocols, domain names, domains creation date, domains expiration dates, domains NLP scores (help determine if a domain name is machine generated) and more.

Displays information about FTP connections detected in the monitored traffic. Includes information such as FTP commands, file paths.

### Files

Displays information about files that were detected in the network traffic in any protocol. Includes information such as file hashes, MIME types, source IPs.

### HTTP

Displays information about HTTP connections, includes information such as hostnames, web methods, URIs, amount of bytes transferred, HTTP referrers, user-agents, MIME types.

### Tunnels

Displays information about tunnelled connections as detected in the monitored traffic.

### X.509

Displays information about X.509 certificates that have traversed the network.

### Notices

Displays security issues that were detected by Zeek.

### Weird

Displays possible security issues that were detected by Zeek. Issues presented here not necessarily mean that thereâ€™s a security issue with your network but it is an indication that something might need to be investigated.

## NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)

Displays security issues that were detected by Suricata.
