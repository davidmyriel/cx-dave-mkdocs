Once you create your account you will need to set up your plan based on amount of logs you are going to send to Coralogix. To calculate a needed quota you need to decide which your data are high, medium, low priority. 1 GB purchased for frequent search (high priority) is equivalent to 2.5GB for monitoring (medium priority) and 6.5GB for compliance (Low priority).
