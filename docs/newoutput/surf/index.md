Addressing a long-overlooked business asset, the browser, SURF Security transforms it into a robust security layer, ensuring complete end-user privacy with full compliance. Through an identity-first approach, SURF grants secure and seamless access to all SaaS and corporate assets via a centralized platform, enhancing security, performance, and productivity for end-users and applications.
