The Coralogix STA is a tool built by Coralogix that can analyze raw traffic packets seen by it by using traffic mirroring (in AWS it's called VPC Traffic Mirroring), collect information about hosts from the hosts themselves by using a Wazuh agent. In addition, Wazuh can collect information from the cloud provider such as AWS from services such as AWS Inspector, AWS CloudTrail and others.

As such a broad solution, it produces a variety of different event types, each one with it's own set of fields. In this article I will go over the most common data types that the STA produces, their meaning and important fields by the Subsystem Name they use. If you come across an event type that is not mentioned here please let us know and we'll add it:

1. **zeek\_conn** - These events provide information about every connection that the Zeek engine of the STA has seen. It will include information about the source and destination IP addresses and ports, MAC addresses, protocol used, bytes sent and received, if the connection was tunnelled, it will contain a linking ID that allows the user to cross reference several logs. This is the list of fields that are included in each such event (fields written in red are core fields and therefore will appear in most of the other events too):
    1. security.event\_type - A string that indicates the type of data that is included in the event. Used to create the subsystem name value.
    2. **security.uid** - A unique identifier of the connection. Generated by Zeek automatically.
    3. **security.source\_ip** - The IP address of the connection initiator.
    4. **security.source\_geo** - The geographical information (both lat/lon coordinates and textual information about the relevant country, city, etc.
    5. **security.source\_port** \- The source port used by this connection.
    6. **security.destination\_ip** - The IP address of the connection responder.
    7. **security.destination\_geo** - The geographical information (both lat/lon coordinates and textual information about the relevant country, city, etc.
    8. **security.destination\_port** - The destination port used by this connection.
    9. **security.protocol** - The protocol used (e.g. tcp, udp, icmp)
    10. **security.hostname** \- A string that indicates the STA instance itself.
    11. **security.source\_filename** - The name of the file on the STA that contained the raw information in this event.
    12. **security.source\_filename\_pos** - The position in the file security.source\_filename which this event was read from
    13. **security.logshipper\_before\_filters\_timestamp** - This field is used by Coralogix to help detect and investigate logs shipping issues in the STA.
    14. **security.\_write\_ts** \- This field is used by Coralogix to help detect and investigate logs shipping issues in the STA.
    15. **security.logshipper\_before\_output\_timestamp** - This field is used by Coralogix to help detect and investigate logs shipping issues in the STA.
    16. **security.community\_id** - This field contains a hash of the source IP, source port, destination IP and destination port. You can use this field to pivot to other logs (such as from a zeek\_conn log to a suricata\_flow or suricata\_alert) about the same connection, for example - see this screenshot:  
        ![](images/Screenshot-from-2021-12-26-12-10-58.png)
    17. security.security.local\_orig - A boolean indicating whether the source IP address is a private IP.

    20. security.connection\_state - The state of the connection according to the following list:
        1. S0: Connection attempt seen, no reply.
        2. S1: Connection established, not terminated.
        3. SF: Normal establishment and termination. Note that this is the same symbol as for state S1. You can tell the two apart because for S1 there will not be any byte counts in the summary, while for SF there will be.
        4. REJ: Connection attempt rejected.
        5. S2: Connection established and close attempt by originator seen (but no reply from responder).
        6. S3: Connection established and close attempt by responder seen (but no reply from originator).

        8. RSTR: Responder sent a RST.
        9. RSTOS0: Originator sent a SYN followed by a RST, we never saw a SYN-ACK from the responder.
        10. RSTRH: Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a RST, we never saw a SYN from the (purported) originator.
        11. SH: Originator sent a SYN followed by a FIN, we never saw a SYN ACK from the responder (hence the connection was “half” open).
        12. SHR: Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a FIN, we never saw a SYN from the originator.
        13. OTH: No SYN seen, just midstream traffic (one example of this is a “partial connection” that was not later closed).

    22. security.info\_type - Domain name parsing enrichment. This field contain a value indicating the type of data that was sent in the query - IPv4, IPv6, Domain or Malformed.
    23. security.creation\_date - Domain stats enrichment. The creation date of the queried domain name. This field can be quite useful in detecting connections (even encrypted ones!!!) to "baby domains" i.e. domains that were registered in the past three months or less and therefore are often associated with malicious activities.

    15. security.ref\_addr - Above stratum 1, when using IPv4, the IP address of the reference clock. Note that the NTP protocol did not originally specify a large enough field to represent IPv6 addresses, so they use the first four bytes of the MD5 hash of the reference clock’s IPv6 address (i.e. an IPv4 address here is not necessarily IPv4).

    4. security.version - SSH major version (1, 2, or unset). The version can be unset if the client and server version strings are unset, malformed or incompatible so no common version can be extracted.

    1. security.virtualhost - The host name specified in URL on the client side.
