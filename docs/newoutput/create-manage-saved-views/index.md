Create and manage Saved Views using Folders in the Coralogix [Explore Screen](https://coralogix.com/docs/explore-screen/).

## Create Saved Views

**STEP 1**. Click on the ellipsis next to **Unsaved View** in the upper left-hand corner of your [Explore Screen](https://coralogix.com/docs/explore-screen/).

**STEP 2**. You may add a view name for the particular view, decide whether to save query and filters and set the view as your default dashboard. You may also determine the view’s privacy settings: private or shared.

**Note**: To save a query as part of a saved view, you must run the query first.

## Manage Saved Views with Folders

Manage your Saved Views in a more organized way using Folders.

**STEP 1**. Search for an existing folder to store your saved view or create a new one by clicking the folder icon.

**STEP 2**. Drag and drop your saved views into the relevant folder.

Saved views will appear in the right-hand column as either private or shared in their respective folders. Drag and drop views between folders.
