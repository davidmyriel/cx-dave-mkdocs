Use the **Manage Admins** page to view, add, and remove [Organization Administrators](http://www.coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/managing-your-organization) belonging your organization.

## Overview

The **Manage Admins** page contains a list of all of the Organization Administrators (Org Admins) in your organization. It also contains a list of those users who are members of your organization, but not currently administrators.

To help manage the organization, the Org Admin may add additional administrators with the same permissions and authorities. They can assign several users to be Org Admins and can unassign users who are currently assigned as Org Admins.
