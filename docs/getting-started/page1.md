## Core Features

### Data Collection and Centralized Storage 
Coralogix provides integrations with popular logging frameworks and libraries, enabling you to easily transfer your data to Coralogix for centralized storage and analysis. With our unique Streama© technology, you can analyze your data without needing to index it, thereby avoiding costly storage expenses.

### Data transformation and parsing 

Coralogix automatically parses and structures your telemetry data.
- Parse your data to make it easier to search, filter, and analyze. Get started with our Parsing Rules Cheat Sheet.
- Enrich your data with business, operations, or security information, including IP-based geographical information, that may not be available at runtime. AWS customers can enrich their logs with tags from their AWS EC2 instances to connect their business and operation metadata, and gain greater insight into their data.
- Record new metric time series to produce leaner and more quickly queried metrics.

### Data query
Extract specific information or insights from your collected logs, metrics, and traces using Lucene, SQL, or our advanced DataPrime query language. We make it possible for you to directly query your archived data at a speed 5x faster than Athena.

### Alerting
By querying logs and metrics, you can set up alerts and notifications based on specific conditions or thresholds. These alerts can notify you when predefined events occur or when metrics deviate from normal behavior.

### Monitoring 
Monitor your data using our advanced Explore screen, where you can drill down into your logs and traces. Engage with our Events2Metrics functionality to generate metrics from your spans and logs to optimize storage without sacrificing important data. What’s more, we offer application performance monitoring (APM) which decorates our standard observability options with additional information.
