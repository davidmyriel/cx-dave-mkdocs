Streamline the process of ingesting and analyzing logs from your AWS resources using our automated **WAF Logs using AWS Kinesis Data Firehose** integration package.

## Overview

Web Application Firewall (WAF) logs are detailed records of web traffic and security events generated by AWS Web Application Firewall. These logs contain critical information about incoming requests, such as IP addresses, request types, response codes, and potential security threats or attacks. The value of WAF logs lies in their role in enhancing the security and compliance of your web applications. They provide visibility into potential threats and attacks, enabling you to monitor and safeguard your applications against malicious activities and ensuring compliance with security standards and regulations.

## Benefits

- Gain deeper insights, conduct advanced analytics, set up proactive alerting, and monitor your WAF logs in real time, enhancing your ability to troubleshoot and maintain optimal system performance.

- Using AWS Kinesis Data Firehose streamlines the data delivery process by providing a reliable and scalable data transfer mechanism. It ensures that your log data reaches Coralogix with minimal latency and no loss of data.

## **Configuration**

**STEP 1**. From your Coralogix toolbar, navigate to **Data Flow** > **Integrations**.

- **Integration Name.** Enter a name for your integration. This will be used as a stack name in CloudFormation.

- **API Key**. Enter your [Send-Your-Data API key](https://www.notion.so/d6f178687d464c58b9988fe223c719cc?pvs=21) or click **CREATE A NEW KEY** to create a new API key for the integration.

- **Application Name.** Enter an [application name](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/application-and-subsystem-names/). The default name is AWS.

- **Subsystem Name.** Enter a [subsystem name](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/application-and-subsystem-names/). The default name is Firehose.

- **Enable Dynamic Metadata**. \[**Optional**\] When enabled, this sets the `applicationName` and `subsystemName` dynamically. When enabled, this feature dynamically sets the `applicationName` based on the web ACL name.

- **Kinesis Stream ARN**. \[**Optional**\] Enter the ARN of the Kinesis stream if using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams as a source for logs.

- **AWS Region.** Select your AWS region from the dropdown menu.

- **AWS PrivateLink (Advanced Settings)**. \[**Optional**\] Enabling the use of AWS PrivateLink is **recommended** to ensure a secure and private connection between your VPCs and AWS services. Find out more [here](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/coralogix-amazon-web-services-aws-privatelink-endpoints/).

**STEP 6.** Click **NEXT**.

**STEP 7.** Review the instructions for your integration. Click **CREATE CLOUDFORMATION**.

**STEP 8.** You will be rerouted to the AWS website. Verify that all of the auto pre-populated values are correct. Click **Create Stack**.

**STEP 9.** Return to the Coralogix application where you will be presented with instructions on how to start sending logs about traffic from your Web ACLs.

**Notes**:

If you provide a Kinesis Stream ARN, Coralogix assumes that the data is in the stream and does not provide any additional instructions. It is the user’s responsibility to deliver data to the stream. Instead of the instructions you will see a message that prompts the user to confirm the integration.

**STEP 10**. Click **COMPLETE** to close the module.

**STEP 11.** \[**Optional**\] Deploy the AWS WAF [extension package](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/extension-packages/) to complement your integration needs.

**STEP 12.** View the logs by navigating to **Explore** > **Logs** in your Coralogix toolbar. Find out more [here](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/logs-screen/).
