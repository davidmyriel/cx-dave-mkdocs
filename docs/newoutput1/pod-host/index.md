Our [application performance monitoring](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/blog/application-performance-monitoring-visibility/) (APM) provides you with all logs relevant to a particular span context, granting a full picture of the services that power your applications.

Use our newest layers of observability – `**POD**` and `**HOST**` – to:

- Instantly view all of your pod and host metrics, including resource consumption and associated network information

- Compare metrics within a specific pod and across pods from a specific service

- Correlate between Kubernetes spans, logs, and metrics for a specific pod and/or host

- Troubleshoot log span errors

- Annotate deployment tags based on span context

## **Concepts**

Spans and traces form the basis of your Coralogix APM journey.

Using this telemetry data, Coralogix allows you to observe **application resource consumption** and **infrastructure resource consumption** using two new observability layers.

| POD | application resource consumption | Key factors that impact response times and throughput of applications |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HOST | infrastructure resource consumption | Usage of IT resources, systems, and processes |

## Access Pod & Host Features
