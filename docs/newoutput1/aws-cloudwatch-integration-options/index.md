**Amazon CloudWatch** collects and visualizes real-time logs, metrics, and event data in automated dashboards to streamline your infrastructure and application maintenance. Send these to Coralogix to enhance your data management, analysis, and monitoring capabilities.

Coralogix provides multiple methods to collect logs and metrics from Amazon CloudWatch.

## Custom Coralogix Experience

Use any of our customized **cost-optimized** options to allow Coralogix to ingest the logs stored in your S3 bucket and process them for further analysis and monitoring. Alternatively, take advantage of our customized **performance-optimized** AWS Kinesis Data Firehose integration options.

- **Automated Integration Packages (Recommended)**. Deploy the Coralogix Lambda function using our two-step automated [integration packages](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/integration-packages/).

- **Serverless Application Repository (SAR).** Deploy the [Coralogix Lambda function](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/cloudwatch-logs/) via our AWS serverless application repository.

- **AWS Kinesis Data Firehose**. Select the Coralogix destination in your AWS Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to forward your [logs](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/aws-firehose/) and [metrics](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/amazon-kinesis-data-firehose-metrics/) to Coralogix.

- **Terraform**. Install and manage the CloudWatch integration with AWS services as modules in your infrastructure code using our [AWS CloudWatch](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/terraform-modules/) or [AWS Kinesis with Lambda Function](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/aws-kinesis-with-lambda-function-terraform-module/) Terraform modules.

## Open Source Tools

To reduce costs, you have the option of sending us your CloudWatch data using our [OpenTelemetry integration](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/opentelemetry/).
