Coralogix is a cloud-based, SaaS analytics and monitoring platform that combines [logs, metrics, and traces](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/blog/understand-three-pillars-observability/) to gain full observability into your system using one tool. The platform ingests data from any digital source and transforms it using our [core features](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/coralogix-features-tour/), allowing you to fully understand your system, analyze that data efficiently, and respond to incidents before they become problems.

To get started with Coralogix, sign up for a free account and import your system’s telemetry. Once data is ingested by our platform, you can use our core features to obtain full observability in your Coralogix dashboard.
