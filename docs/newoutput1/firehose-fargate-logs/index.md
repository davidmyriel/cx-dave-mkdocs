Streamline the process of ingesting and analyzing logs from your AWS resources using our automated **EKS Fargate Logs using AWS Kinesis Data Firehose** integration package.

## Overview

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Fargate logs are the records of events, activities, and information generated by containers running within the EKS Fargate environment. These logs provide essential insights into the operation and performance of your containerized applications. They encompass data related to application behavior, errors, resource usage, and security events. The value of EKS Fargate logs lies in their ability to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your containerized workloads within EKS. These logs are instrumental for identifying issues, tracking resource utilization, ensuring application reliability, and enhancing security by detecting potential threats.

## Benefits

- Ensure effective monitoring, troubleshooting, and management of your containerized applications within EKS.

- Using AWS Kinesis Data Firehose streamlines the data delivery process by providing a reliable and scalable data transfer mechanism. It ensures that your log data reaches Coralogix with minimal latency and no loss of data.

## **Configuration**

**STEP 1**. From your Coralogix toolbar, navigate to **Data Flow** > **Integrations**.

**STEP 2.** In the Integrations section, select **AWS EKS Fargate Logs via Firehose**.

**STEP 3.** Click **ADD NEW**.

**STEP 4.** Input your integration details.

- **Integration Name.** Enter a name for your integration. This will be used as a stack name in CloudFormation.

- **API Key**. Enter your [Send-Your-Data API key](https://www.notion.so/d6f178687d464c58b9988fe223c719cc?pvs=21) or click **CREATE A NEW KEY** to create a new API key for the integration.

- **Application Name.** Enter an [application name](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/application-and-subsystem-names/). The default name is AWS.

- **Subsystem Name.** Enter a [subsystem name](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/application-and-subsystem-names/). The default name is Firehose.

- **Enable Dynamic Metadata**. When enabled, this sets the `applicationName` and `subsystemName` dynamically. When enabled, this feature dynamically sets the `applicationName` based on the name of the `kubernetes.namespace_name` field and the `subsystemName` based on the `kubernetes.container_name` field.

- **Kinesis Stream ARN**. \[**Optional**\] Enter the ARN of the Kinesis stream if using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams as a source for logs.

- **AWS Region.** Select your AWS region from the dropdown menu.

- **AWS PrivateLink (Advanced Settings)**. Enabling the use of AWS PrivateLink is **recommended** to ensure a secure and private connection between your VPCs and AWS services. Find out more [here](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/coralogix-amazon-web-services-aws-privatelink-endpoints/).

**STEP 6.** Click **NEXT**.

**STEP 7.** Review the instructions for your integration. Click **CREATE CLOUDFORMATION**.

**STEP 8.** You will be rerouted to the AWS website. Verify that all of the auto pre-populated values are correct. Click **Create Stack**.

**STEP 9.** Return to the Coralogix application where you will be presented with instructions on how to configure `log_router` built into Fargate Kubelet to route your application logs to the Kinesis Data Firehose stream.

**Notes**:

If you provide a Kinesis Stream ARN, Coralogix assumes that the data is in the stream and does not provide any additional instructions. It is the user’s responsibility to deliver data to the stream. Instead of the instructions you will see a message that prompts the user to confirm the integration.

**STEP 10**. Click **COMPLETE** to close the module.

**STEP 11.** \[**Optional**\] Deploy the [extension package](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/extension-packages/) of your choice to complement your integration needs. We offer the following extensions for data originating from CloudTrail and WAF:

- AWS CloudTrail

- AWS WAF

**STEP 12.** View the logs by navigating to **Explore** > **Logs** in your Coralogix toolbar. Find out more [here](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/logs-screen/).
