As [Organization Administrator](http://www.coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/managing-your-organization), you can manage the teams in your organization on your **My Teams** page.

## Overview

The **My Teams** page allows Organization Administrators (Org Admins) to manage their teams from a single convenient location.

- Connect and disconnect teams from your organization.

- For each team, view the number of members it has, [data usage quota](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/data-usage/), and [retention](https://coralogixstg.wpengine.com/docs/archive-retention-policy/).
