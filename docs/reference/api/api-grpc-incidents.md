# Incidents API

## Overview

This document outlines the Incidents Management API. It includes various methods for managing incidents, such as retrieving incident details, listing incidents, aggregating incidents, assigning and unassigning incidents, acknowledging and resolving incidents, and more. The service is designed to handle all operations related to incident management within Coralogix.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following:

- [API Key for Alerts, Rules & Tags to successfully authenticate.](https://coralogix.com/docs/alerts-rules-tags-api-key/)
- [Management API Endpoint that corresponds with your Coralogix subscription.](https://coralogix.com/docs/management-api-endpoints/)
- Administrator permissions to manage your services.

## Authentication

Coralogix API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and [manage your API keys](https://coralogix.com/docs/alerts-rules-tags-api-key/) from the Data Flow tab in Coralogix. You need to use this API key in the Authorization request
header to successfully connect.

Example:

```markdown
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_HERE"
```

Then, use one of our designated **[Management Endpoints](https://coralogix.com/docs/management-api-endpoints/)** to structure your header. 

```markdown
-d @ ng-api-grpc.coralogix.com:443
```

For the Incidents Service API, the service name will be `IncidentsService`.

```bash
com.coralogixapis.incidents.v1.IncidentsService/
```

The complete request header should look like this:

```bash
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_HERE" -d @ ng-api-grpc.coralogix.com:443 com.coralogixapis.incidents.v1.IncidentsService/
```

### Sample Request 

Lists all available incidents based on specified filters and order. In this case, incidents are shown per `assignee`. The list is ordered in an unspecified direction and sorted by time created.

```bash
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer APY_KEY_HERE" -d @ ng-api-grpc.coralogix.com:443 com.coralogixapis.incidents.v1.IncidentsService/ListIncidents <<EOF 
{
    "filter": {
        "assignee": [

        ]},

        }
    ]
}
